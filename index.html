<h1> About Me </h1>

<p>Hi there! My name is a William Kong and I'm currently a mathematics student specializing in mathematical finance at the <a href="https://www.uwaterloo.ca">University of Waterloo</a>. On occasion I will be working in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto">Toronto</a>, Canada, for some of my co-operative terms.</p>

<p>My current interests in mathematics include computational mathematics, optimization theory, stochastic calculus, probability theory, and statistics. Other than mathematics, I have interests in <a href="https://projecteuler.net/profile/wwkong.png">algorithms</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)">functional programming</a>, guitar, and music theory.</p>
